        <h1>Shallow Water</h1>
        <img class="float-left" src="shallow.png" style="width:450px;height:340px;">
        <p>
        This is an interative 3D water demo made in JavaScript and WebGL. This was originally supposed to be a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations">Shallow Water Equations</a>, but we had trouble with instability. Instead we simulated the dynamics somewhat similarly to the Shallow Water Equations, but not quite.
        </p>
        <p>
        This was a project I made with my friend <a href="https://github.com/wayne-wu">Wayne</a>. Click around <a href="https://wayne-wu.github.io/shallow-water/">here</a> to play with it.

        <img class="float-left" src="wasteEngine.png" style="width:450px;height:340px;">
        <p>
        My first attempt at making a 3D graphics engine. It's written in C++, with the rendering taken care of by OpenGL and windowing with GLUT.
        </p>
        <p>
        Meshes can be loaded as models from OBJ files, with the mesh processing taken care of by ASSIMP. Textures can also be loaded in to texture these models.
        </p>
        <p>
        The image to the left is of a dragon mesh I downloaded from the internet textured with a picture of my friend <a href="http://ernest-wong.me/">Ernest</a>.

        <h1>FluidCanvas</h1>
        <img class="float-left" src="smoke.png" style="width:450px;height:340px;">
        <p>
        This is an implementation of a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow">Navier-Stokes</a> equations for incompressible fluids. It also supports vorticity confinement. Most of the theory is explained <a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch38.html">here</a> if you want to build something similar.
        </p>
        <p>
        I wanted it to be interactive through a browser, so I implemented it in Javascript and canvas. Click around <a href="https://rawgit.com/KyleFung/fluidCanvas/smoke/index.html">here</a> to play with it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Free surface tracking is supported using marker cells and particles, but it suffers from pretty bad volume loss.

        <h1>Ray Tracer</h1>
        <img class="float-left" src="rayTracer.png" style="width:450px;height:340px;">
        <p>
        A CPU based implementation of a recursive ray tracer in C++. It calculates color values using Blinn-Phong lighting. Supports shadows and reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
        Reads in scene files and writes out an image in the ppm format.
        </p>
        <p>
        The image to the left is a rendering of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell Box</a>.

        <h1>Voxel Renderer</h1>
        <img class="float-left" src="cubes.png" style="width:450px;height:340px;">
        <p>
        This is a program that generates voxel data, then renders it. The application is written in C++, with the voxel data generation being done in CUDA C and the rendering by OpenGL using CUDA/OpenGL interoperability.
        </p>
        <p>
        This was originally intended to be an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">Marching Cubes</a>, but I had to start school before I could really get it off the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
        The image to the left is a frame shown where the CUDA kernel generating the voxel data generates a checkerboard pattern. Other kernels could be made, but at the moment all this does is render a checkered cube.
